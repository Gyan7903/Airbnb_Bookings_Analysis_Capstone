# Hotel_Bookings_Analysis_EDA_Capstone

## <u>Project Summary</u>
The given dataset is of hotel booking. I explored and analyzed the given dataset and discovered some important factors regarding hotel booking. For this, I first read the given data in my collab notebook and then understand the whole data like what are variables in the given data. After that cleaned the data frame in data wrangling. For that I used some functions like drop(), fillna(), isna()/isnull() functions. Then I added some columns which are required in the analysis and removed some columns which are not required. Using this data frame I explored some variables using visualization charts like pie charts, count plots, barplot, and heatmaps and I can find out some insights which are important factors. From these insights, I can suggest some business objectives to clients.

## <u>Problem Statement</u>
In this project we are going to analyse Hotel Booking dataset. This dataset contains information of city hotel and resort hotel, and includes information of booking time, length of stay, number of adults, children and/or babies, also have information of avaliable parking space, among other thing.

The objective of this project is explore and analyse the data to discover important factors regarding Hotels booking and its attributes.

2) I am able to achieve the same things by showing to client which hotel is most preferred , percentage of repeated guests, mostly preferred food by guests, then which hotel has highest adr etc.
3) Most preferred room type is achieved by countplot so the client can be well prepare in advance and this insight help client for further enhancement of their hospatility.
4) I am able to show which food type is mostly preferred so client can offer the mostly preferred food to the guests.
5) Most preferred month are shown by barplot so client can be well prepared in advanced so that minimum grivances would be faced by client.
6) Using barplot I am able to show which hotel type has high adr so client can analyse which hotel has high income.
7) I am able to show which hotel is busiest hotel sp client can do relatable changes in facilities in less busy hotel type.
8) I am able to show the relationship between repeated guests and previous bookings not cancelled so client can preferred repeated guests.
9) Using barplot relationship between adr and total number of people is shown so client can preferred maximum number of people.
